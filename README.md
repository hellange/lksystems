Reads temperature and system settings from LK Systems Webserver.
Stores result periodically in a database.

Initially based on [blog post](http://mherman.org/blog/2016/11/05/developing-a-restful-api-with-node-and-typescript/#.WB3zyeErJE4).

More or less completely rewritten after that.

1. Install dependencies - `npm install`
2. Compile (and assets)- `npm run build`
3. Run the development server - `npm start`
